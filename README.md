# enDAQ-calc - a computational backend for vibration analysis

enDAQ-calc is a package comprising a collection of common calculations for vibration analysis. It leverages the standard Python scientific stack (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas) in order to enable engineers to perform domain-specific calculations in a few lines of code, without having to first master Python and its scientific stack in their entireties.

enDAQ-calc is a sub-package of the larger enDAQ ecosystem. See [the enDAQ package](https://github.com/MideTechnology/endaq-python) for more details.

## Installation

enDAQ-calc is available on PYPI via `pip`::

    pip install endaq-calc

For the most recent features that are still under development, you can also use `pip` to install enDAQ-calc directly from GitHub:

    pip install git+https://github.com/MideTechnology/endaq-python-calc.git@development
